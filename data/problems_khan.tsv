rotate-2d-shapes-to-make-3d-objects	three students attempt to define what it means for overleftrightarrow ab and overleftrightarrow cd to be perpendicular. qquad can you match the teacher's comments to the definitions? definition of perpendicular lines teacher's comments daniela's definition: overleftrightarrow ab is perpendicular to overleftrightarrow cd if the measure of angle aoc equals the measure of angle aod . ori's definition: overleftrightarrow ab is perpendicular to overleftrightarrow cd if overleftrightarrow ab and overleftrightarrow cd intersect perfectly sideways. kaori's definition: overleftrightarrow ab is perpendicular to overleftrightarrow cd if one line can be mapped to the other by a rotation about point o of 90^ circ 90 ∘ . please rework your definition to use more precise mathematical language. well done! because the measure of angle cod is 180^ circ 180 ∘ (by the definition of a straight angle), the measures of angles angle aoc and angle aod must both be 90^ circ 90 ∘ . well done! i hadn't previously considered defining perpendicular lines in terms of a rigid transformation like rotation, but by golly it works!
